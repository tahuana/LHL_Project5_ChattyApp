# ChattyApp

Chatty will allow users to communicate with each other without having to register accounts. It will use React, a popular front-end library created and used heavily by Facebook as well as modern tools for Node including Webpack and Babel.

## Functional Requirements:
* Primarily a client-side SPA (single-page app) built with ReactJS
* Based on the HTML and CSS provided
* Contains a chat log displaying messages and notifications
* Contains an input field to change your name and an input field to send a message
* The client-side app communicates with a server via WebSockets for multi-user real-time updates
* No persistent database is involved; the focus is on the client-side experience

## Behaviour Requirements
* When any connected user sends a chat message, all connected users receive and display the message
* When any connected user changes their name, all connected users are notified of the name change
* Notifications are styled differently from chat messages
* Header will display the count of connected users
* When the number of connected users changes, this count will be updated for all connected users
